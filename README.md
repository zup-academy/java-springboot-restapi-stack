## Java and Spring Boot REST API Stack

The **java-springboot-restapi-stack** is a stack for building REST API applications with Java and Spring Boot following some best practices.

The default template of this stack uses those technologies:

- Java +17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Actuator
- SpringDoc OpenAPI
- Spring Testing and jUnit 5
- Bean Validation

If you need more features, you can apply as many plugins as you want.

## How to use

The following steps show how to import the stack and create an application using the java-springboot-restapi stack.

1. First, import the stack:
```sh
stk import stack https://github.com/zup-academy/java-springboot-restapi-stack
```

2. Now, verify if the stack was imported correctly:
```sh
stk list stack | grep java-springboot
```

3. Create your application and answer all the questions:
```sh
stk create app <app_name> -t java-springboot-restapi-stack/default-template
```

4. Import the application as a Maven project into your IDE and start coding;

5. Now it's time to run the application. Inside its directory, build and run it:
```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Nice! You're ready for production I guess ðŸ¥³
